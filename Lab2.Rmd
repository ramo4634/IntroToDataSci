## About Rachel

1. Whenever I make mac and cheese, I accidentally drop the cheese packet into the boiling water when I pour the noodles in. I would like to conduct a series of mac and cheese related test among a sample of college students and then analyze the data to decide how likely it is to drop the cheese packet into the pot prematurely.  
2. Six months after graduation I will be working for Target as a software engineer. I hope to earn my masters while working and become a data scientist in the next five years.
3. One day, I want to leave the corporate world and get a PhD so I can make mathematical models to study climate change. 
4. I'm hoping to become a master of R. I would also like to get better at Python if at all possible. 
5. My hobbies include telling dad jokes, hiking, camping, drawing, and cooking.
