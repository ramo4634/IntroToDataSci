* Whenever I make mac and cheese, I accidentally drop the cheese packet into the boiling water when I pour the noodles in. I would like to conduct a series of mac and cheese related test among a sample of college students and then analyze the data to decide how likely it is to drop the cheese packet into the pot prematurely.  
* Six months after graduation I will be working for Target as a software engineer. I hope to earn my masters while working and become a data scientist in the next five years.
* One day, I want to leave the corporate world and get a PhD so I can make mathematical models to study climate change. 
* I'm hoping to become a master of R. I would also like to get better at Python if at all possible. 
* My hobbies include telling dad jokes, hiking, camping, drawing, and cooking.

* During the late nate when I need a snack I sometimes get really lazy and eat ramen noodles raw. The ramen becomes a chip rather than some noodles, so I would like to know who else eats their ramen like this?
* Six months after graduation I would have a job with some coding as a part of it. Hopefully in the next five years I will be creating a space beach.
* I wish to be able to do my own research on a topic that will be me intrigued.
* I'm hoping to learn R and get a basis for coding and organizing data.
* My hobbies include longboarding, snowboarding, hiking, playing video games and listening to music.

* What is the amount of sleep that makes me feel the most rested after a typical day? I just cannot seem to figure out a good sleep schedule for me. Perhaps
* Six whole months after graduation, I hope to either be in Grad school or starting a job where I can travel to take data. Half a decade from graduation I hope to find a career i'm passionate about.
* I hope someday in my career I can have a major possitive impact on a person whom I would invest in personally. Also, any kind of award would be cool.
* In this course I hope to learn skills that I can translate into research/intership positions. 
* 2% of the human population are born without ANY wisdom teeth. Fun Fact: I am one of those people.
