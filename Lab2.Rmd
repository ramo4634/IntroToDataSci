## About Rachel

![Picture from Camping in Yellowstone](images/RachelM.jpeg){width=250px}

1. Whenever I make mac and cheese, I accidentally drop the cheese packet into the boiling water when I pour the noodles in. I would like to conduct a series of mac and cheese related test among a sample of college students and then analyze the data to decide how likely it is to drop the cheese packet into the pot prematurely.  
2. Six months after graduation I will be working for Target as a software engineer. I hope to earn my masters while working and become a data scientist in the next five years.
3. One day, I want to leave the corporate world and get a PhD so I can make mathematical models to study climate change. 
4. I'm hoping to become a master of R. I would also like to get better at Python if at all possible. 
5. My hobbies include telling dad jokes, hiking, camping, drawing, and cooking. 

## About Anderson

1. During the late nate when I need a snack I sometimes get really lazy and eat ramen noodles raw. The ramen becomes a chip rather than some noodles, so I would like to know who else eats their ramen like this?
2. Six months after graduation I would have a job with some coding as a part of it. Hopefully in the next five years I will be creating a space beach.
3. I wish to be able to do my own research on a topic that will be me intrigued.
4. I'm hoping to learn R and get a basis for coding and organizing data.
5. My hobbies include longboarding, snowboarding, hiking, playing video games and listening to music.

* During the late nate when I need a snack I sometimes get really lazy and eat ramen noodles raw. The ramen becomes a chip rather than some noodles, so I would like to know who else eats their ramen like this?
* Six months after graduation I would have a job with some coding as a part of it. Hopefully in the next five years I will be creating a space beach.
* I wish to be able to do my own research on a topic that will be me intrigued.
* I'm hoping to learn R and get a basis for coding and organizing data.
* My hobbies include longboarding, snowboarding, hiking, playing video games and listening to music.
*  I've lately been interested in watching short term and long term trends in the stock market.  I'd be interested in learning how to analyze technicals and patterns to predict future trends in the markets.
* Six months after graudation, I will likely go for a professional masters specializing in data science.  When I'm in the workforce in the next five years, I hope to be a data scientist or financial analyst in a big city such as New York.  If I'm lucky, my job will allow me to travel around the world!
* Hopefully, my greatest accomplishment will involve using data science to lead a company to make a very significant and good decision in their business.
* Given these goals, I hope to gain a lot of knowledge of R in this class.  I feel confident in my stats knowledge but I have very little experience with programming.
* I was a competitive tennis player in high school (now coaching), I play chess online, and I enjoy road biking to Denver!

* What is the amount of sleep that makes me feel the most rested after a typical day? I just cannot seem to figure out a good sleep schedule for me. Perhaps
* Six whole months after graduation, I hope to either be in Grad school or starting a job where I can travel to take data. Half a decade from graduation I hope to find a career i'm passionate about.
* I hope someday in my career I can have a major possitive impact on a person whom I would invest in personally. Also, any kind of award would be cool.
* In this course I hope to learn skills that I can translate into research/intership positions. 
* 2% of the human population are born without ANY wisdom teeth. Fun Fact: I am one of those people.
